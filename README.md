# Motorscraper

What is a good price for a Yamaha MT-07? How about a Aprilia Dorsoduro? Does mileage matter in terms of price? How about build year?

This toolkit allows you to completely scrape motorcycle listings on Marktplaats.

Currently the toolkit is in development but has already been used to scrape all MT-07 listings.

The step will be to finish developing a nice view of the data before testing the kit on more listings.

Ultimately my aim is to host the tool online as a serverless web app via a cloud provider so that results can be shared easily.

# How to Use?

- Run scraping.ipynb to scrape a listing.
- Run to_html.pynb to convert the results to a html based overview table that supports sorting.
- Run analytics.ipynb to obtain various graphs that visualize patterns in the data.
